This is Job Tracker Application which has two users : user and Admin, user can view Job applications and Job Postings while Admin can Edit Job Postings and Job Applications. 
I have used postgre-sql for database and ASP.NET MVC framework and for frontend CSS , HTML. 

Note: Usage of any database works (SQL/Postgre-sql) but development of tables has to be done by self according to Models. I have used Code-first approach so usage of Migration commands is preferred.
Data can be added as per Coders choice. Authentication and Authorization is added for Admin and user.
